# README-Generator

## Description

This app was made to help people make a README file for their programs in a easier way, I learned about using async function and making objects from user input during the development of this app. I also learned that you can't loop over certain methods/functions

## Usage

Use this app to generate a README from scratch. Just run the program in the terminal and enter the desired information, after all the information is entered a generated README file will appear for you to use.
